# contineo_bot

### Why even make it when you can use their website ?
* Contineo is a portal that provides autonomy to colleges by allowing students to view their internal scores.
* Our college NMIT uses this portal for these purposes.
* However, their portal is shit. ðŸ˜‚ LOL !
* The students of NMIT will agree  when I say that Contineo is shit. It's buggy, typical waste-of-time software and it's connected to NMIT website which is even more crap.
* To clean their shit, we have built this bot.
* So to solve this problem we have come up with a bot so that you can get your marks hassle-free on your phone just by using Whatsapp and DMing our WhatsApp Business Account.

### What's the cost ? OMG I'm broke ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘

* We know you're broke, that's why we won't charge a penny, we'll ask the college to pay for the server

### Can we edit the marks in Contineo if we use your bot ? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

* Don't act oversmart, if you want to change marks use inspect element ðŸ˜Ž

### My marks are showing incorrectly, what should I do ?
* Talk to your nearest teacher, if you're in hostel it should be a 5 min walk away.
* Don't blame us if you don't get elegibilty for sem end exams.

### Attendance is not showing up ? ðŸ˜¶
* We don't plan on putting attendance feature anytime soon.
