# contineo_bot

Contineo is a portal that provides autonomy to colleges by allowing students to view their internal scores.
Our college NMIT uses this portal for these purposes.
However, their portal is shit. ðŸ˜‚ LOL !
The students of NMIT will agree  when I say that Contineo is shit. It's buggy, typical waste-of-time software and it's connected to NMIT website which is even more crap.
To clean their shit, we have built this bot.
So to solve this problem we have come up with a bot so that you can get your marks hassle-free on your phone just by using Whatsapp and DMing our WhatsApp Business Account.
